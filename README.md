# cone

üç¶ vanilla js static pwa generator, built in ts for [Oogy: Can You Help](https://oogycanyouhelp.com).

Does not require any dependencies (uses Typescript interally to generate `Cone.js`).

Wraps all DOM/browser methods and classes so üç¶ cone generates to a string consistently in every environment.

Why? For fun! I thought a completely in-house static website generator would be a good thing to maintain using current ECMAScript standards for my current projects, as well as a demo of some of the techniques from [Oogy: Can You Help](https://oogycanyouhelp.com) itself.

## Install

In Browser, download `dist/` and place the `Cone.js` somewhere in your website.

```html
<script src="Cone.js"></script>
```

In NodeJS, as simple as:

```bash
npm install oogy-cone
```

Then in any environment:

```ts
import { Cone } from "Cone.js"; // or 'oogy-cone'

const template = {
  // üç¶ .cone template
};

// -> or alternatively, in NodeJS contexts:
// import fs from 'fs';
// const data = fs.readFileSync('example.cone', 'utf8');
// -> just as in browser, you could import a data file from somewhere using <script>

const website = Cone.ConeBuilder.build({
  template,
});
```

> NOTE: see [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) to configure anything about the build process.

## Usage

In Browser:

```html
<script>
  const website = Cone.ConeBuilder.build({
    template: {
      // üç¶ .cone template goes here
    },
  });

  document.body.innerHTML += website;
</script>
```

In Express:

```ts
const app = express();
app.use("/", (req, res) => {
  const template = fs.readFileSync("example.cone", "utf8");
  const website = Cone.ConeBuilder.build({
    template,
  });
  res.set("Content-Type", "text/html");
  res.send(website);
});
```

[See example/ for a tiny example of using üç¶ cone with Express to serve a website using an `example.cone` file](example/)

## .cone

### example

```js
{
  /* content tabs */
  "tabs": [
    {
      /* title of this tab */
      "title": "üç¶ cone example",

      /* content/"body" of this tab */
      "content": {
        /* style, which will help the elements look nice */
        "style": "jumbotron",

        /* list of elements we want to show in this tab */
        "elements": [
          {
            /* this is an image type */
            "type": "img",

            /* here is the image src attribute, which can be any URL that works from where the site is hosted */
            "src": "/png/jumbotron.png"
          },
          {
            /* h1 header type, all normal HTML types are used, and inline styles so its easy to customize after generating as well */
            "type": "h1",

            /* we'll want to fill in the text for the title elements instead of the `src` attribute */
            "text": "Oogy: Can You Help"
          },
          {
            /* finally, a p element which works as a subtitle in this case on the jumbotron style */
            "type": "p",
            "text": "Indie narrative deckbuilder."
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
```
