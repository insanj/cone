# cone

üç¶ vanilla js static pwa generator, built in ts for [Oogy: Can You Help](https://oogycanyouhelp.com).

Does not require any dependencies (uses Typescript interally to generate `Cone.js`).

Wraps all DOM/browser methods and classes so üç¶ cone generates to a string consistently in every environment.

Why? For fun! I thought a completely in-house static website generator would be a good thing to maintain using current ECMAScript standards for my current projects, as well as a demo of some of the techniques from [Oogy: Can You Help](https://oogycanyouhelp.com) itself.

## Install

In Browser, download `dist/` and place the `Cone.js` somewhere in your website.

```html
<script src="Cone.js"></script>
```

In NodeJS, as simple as:

```bash
npm install oogy-cone
```

Then in any environment:

```ts
import { Cone } from "Cone.js"; // or 'oogy-cone'

const template = {
  // üç¶ .cone template
};

// -> or alternatively, in NodeJS contexts:
// import fs from 'fs';
// const data = fs.readFileSync('example.cone', 'utf8');
// -> just as in browser, you could import a data file from somewhere using <script>

const website = Cone.ConeBuilder.build({
  template,
});
```

> NOTE: see [tsconfig.json](tsconfig.json) to configure anything about the build process.

## Usage

```ts
const app = express();
app.use("/", (req, res) => {
  const template = fs.readFileSync("example.cone", "utf8");
  const website = Cone.ConeBuilder.build({
    template,
  });
  res.set("Content-Type", "text/html");
  res.send(website);
});
```

[See example/ for a tiny example of using üç¶ cone with Express to serve a website using an `example.cone` file](example/)

## .cone

### example

```json
{
  "title": "üç¶ cone-example"
}
```
