Does not require any dependencies. Treats Browser and Node.js equally. Uses Typescript interally to generate `Cone.js` for either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or inline usage.

Wraps all Browser (DOM) methods and classes so üç¶ cone generates to a string consistently in every environment. No need for `window`, `document`, `Element`, or `jquery`.

Why? For fun! I thought a completely in-house static website generator would be a good thing to maintain using current ECMAScript standards for my current projects, as well as a demo of some of the techniques from [Oogy: Can You Help](https://oogycanyouhelp.com) itself.

## Techniques

Some noteworthy techniques used in üç¶ cone that may be nice learning opportunities:

- TypeScript module with deep `type`, `class` usage which is identical on any platform
- Adding complex `onclick` handlers when generating HTML elements for tab swapping, animations (which also uses `window.crypto.randomUUID()` to prevent overlap)
- Adding CSS keyframe animations in a `<style>` element served with the final result
- Adding responsive JS scaling handler via transparent `<image>` pixel per tab content element
- Including `<link>` preload and `<meta>` viewport tags in the case of full HTML replacement
- Using `dist/` directory, exporting declarations, and minifying the final output with Typescript and command line tools

## Install

In Browser, download `dist/` and place the `Cone.min.js` (or `Cone.js`) somewhere in your website.

```html
<script src="Cone.min.js"></script>
```

In NodeJS, as simple as:

```bash
npm install oogy-cone
```

Then in any environment:

```ts
import { Cone } from "Cone.js";
// or 'oogy-cone', 'Cone.min.js', 'Cone' depending on your context

const template = {
  // üç¶ .cone template, either in utf-8 string or JSON
};

// -> or alternatively, in NodeJS contexts:
// import fs from 'fs';
// const data = fs.readFileSync('example.cone', 'utf8');
// -> just as in browser, you could import a data file from somewhere using <script>

const website = Cone.ConeBuilder.build({
  template,
});
```

> NOTE: see [tsconfig.json](https://github.com/insanj/cone/blob/main/tsconfig.json) to configure anything about the build process.

## Usage

In Browser:

```html
<script type="module">
  import { Cone } from "./Cone.min.js";
  const website = Cone.ConeBuilder.build({
    template: {
      // üç¶ .cone template goes here
    },
  });

  document.body.innerHTML += website;
</script>
```

[See example.html for a tiny example of using üç¶ cone with a single .html file, and no external files besides the Cone.min.js release](https://github.com/insanj/cone/blob/main/example.html/)

Use the following command to experiment with Browser usage locally:

```bash
npm run example-html
```

In Express:

```ts
const app = express();
app.use("/", (req, res) => {
  const template = fs.readFileSync("example.cone", "utf8");
  const website = Cone.ConeBuilder.build({
    template,
  });
  res.set("Content-Type", "text/html");
  res.send(website);
});
```

[See example/ for a tiny example of using üç¶ cone with Express to serve a website using an `example.cone` file](https://github.com/insanj/cone/blob/main/example/)

Use the following command to experiment with Node usage locally:

```ts
npm run example
```
